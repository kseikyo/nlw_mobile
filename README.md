# Mobile of ECOLETA

[ECOLETA](TODO ADD LINK) is an web application developed to help people discard waste such as lamps, stacks, batteries and many more. It does so by mapping collection spots so everyone can be in touch with the entity who does the job. The process starts by some entity registering their data into the website, then anyone using the mobile app will be able to see it and get in touch.

## Design

This application's design was made by the [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) team and made available during the NLW or Next Level Week, you can currently check the prototype [here](https://www.figma.com/file/1SxgOMojOB2zYT0Mdk28lB/?viewer=1&node-id=).

## Stack

The mobile was built using React Native with Typescript using EXPO. Some requirements were met by using dependencies such as [react-native-maps](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-maps) for map interaction, [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for using http requests on the [server](https://github.com/kseikyo/nlw_server), [react-native-picker-select](https://github.com/lawnstarter/react-native-picker-select) to emulate a native <select> tag on any device, expo-location to get the user current location, and many more.
